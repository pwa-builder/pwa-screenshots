# pwa-screenshots

This tool is used on the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) website to generate screenshots from a URL. Internally, it uses [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) to generate the screenshots.

To get the project running on your system (note that you will first need NodeJS), you can do the following:
1. Run npm install
2. Run npm start
